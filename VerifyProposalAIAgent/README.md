# TruthValidator Smart Contract & Voting System

## ⛓️ The Decentralized Truth Consensus Layer

At the heart of TruthValidator lies this open-source smart contract system - a revolutionary approach to establishing truth through decentralized consensus. This component enables:

- **Community-Powered Verification:** On-chain voting for truth determination
- **AI-Assisted Judgments:** Smart contracts that integrate AI analysis
- **Tamper-Proof Records:** Immutable blockchain storage of all decisions
- **Transparent Governance:** Fully auditable verification processes

## 🗳️ How Decentralized Truth Verification Works

1. **Proposal Submission:** Users submit claims via Telegram bot
2. **AI Preliminary Analysis:** AI Agent provides initial assessment
3. **Community Voting:** Token holders vote on claim validity
4. **Consensus Recording:** Results permanently stored on blockchain
5. **Evidence Archiving:** All supporting materials stored on IPFS/Filecoin
